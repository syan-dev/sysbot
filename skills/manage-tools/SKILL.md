description: Install, list, enable/disable, and remove LeSysBot tools — from GitHub with `lesysbot tools install`, from the terminal, or via the local web dashboard — including the trust model, pinning, and updating installed packages. Use when asked to "install a tool", "add the gpu-temp tool", "disable a tool", "remove a tool", "update a tool", or "open the dashboard".

# Manage LeSysBot tools

Tools live as folder packages (or loose `.py` files) in the tools dir —
`~/.lesysbot/tools/` for an installed setup. Two equivalent interfaces manage
them: the `lesysbot tools` CLI (no running bot needed) and the web dashboard.
Both act on the same state file and directory the bot loads.

## The CLI

```bash
lesysbot tools install owner/repo   # install package(s) from a GitHub repo
lesysbot tools list                 # every tool: status, source package, origin
lesysbot tools info gpu_temp        # params, platform gating, provenance
lesysbot tools disable gpu_temp     # hide from the LLM; /gpu_temp refuses to run
lesysbot tools enable gpu_temp      # turn it back on
lesysbot tools remove gpu_temp      # DELETE its folder/.py (asks y/N; --yes skips)
```

- **disable/enable** — reversible, persisted to `tool_state.json`. A disabled
  tool is hidden from the LLM's schemas *and* refuses direct `/` calls, but
  stays listed so it can be re-enabled. A running bot applies CLI changes on
  next restart (the dashboard applies them live).
- **remove** — permanent: deletes the whole folder package or loose `.py`,
  **including any sibling tools defined in the same package** (listed before
  the confirm). Installed packages also get their `tools.lock.json` entry
  cleaned. Hot-reload drops it from a running bot immediately. Prefer
  *disable* if the tool might be wanted back.
- `list`/`info` show provenance: `owner/repo@commit7` for installed packages,
  `local` for hand-written ones.

## Installing from GitHub

Installs are **by GitHub link only** — no registry or catalog:

```bash
lesysbot tools install owner/repo                  # whole repo (HEAD)
lesysbot tools install owner/repo@v1.2             # pin branch / tag / 40-hex SHA
lesysbot tools install owner/repo/tools/gpu-temp   # one package in a bigger repo
lesysbot tools install https://github.com/owner/repo
lesysbot tools install owner/repo --only gpu-temp  # cherry-pick from a multi-tool repo
```

Downloads as a zip (no git binary needed), prints the plan — package names,
versions, every file that will land in the tools dir — and asks y/N before
writing. A running bot with hot-reload activates new packages immediately.

- **Trust model:** installed tools are arbitrary Python running as your user,
  no sandbox. Install only from trusted repos (read `tool.py` — they're
  small); prefer pinning `@tag`/`@sha`. The exact commit is recorded in
  `tools.lock.json` either way. `--yes` skips the prompt — scripts only.
- **Pip deps:** a package's `requirements.txt` is **printed**, not run;
  `--install-deps` opts in to running it.
- **Private repos:** set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`).
- **Collisions:** the installer refuses to overwrite a folder it didn't
  create (hand-written tools are safe); `--force` overrides.
- **Updating:** re-install a package the lock already owns and it's replaced
  in place — that *is* the update path.
- Bundled packages install by path: `lesysbot tools install syan-dev/lesysbot/tools/gpu-temp`.

What counts as a package in a repo: a root `tool.py` makes the repo itself one
package; otherwise every immediate subdir holding a non-`_` `.py` is one —
looked for under `tools/` first when the repo has that folder, else at the
repo root (`tests/`, `docs/`, dot-/`_`-prefixed dirs skipped).

## The dashboard

A local web UI showing every tool (enabled/disabled, availability with the
reason, `platforms`/`requires`/`confirm` tags) plus an LLM health banner
(backend reachable? latency? is the configured model present?).

```bash
pip install ".[dashboard]"   # optional extra (included by the install scripts)
lesysbot --dashboard         # → http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Or persist in config: `dashboard: {enabled: true, host: "127.0.0.1", port: 8765}`.
Toggle/Remove buttons do exactly what the CLI verbs do — but apply **live**.
Scriptable JSON API: `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/llm/health`,
`POST /api/tools/{name}/toggle`, `POST /api/tools/{name}/remove`.

**Security:** binds `127.0.0.1`, **no auth**. Don't expose `host` publicly
without your own auth/proxy — anyone reaching the port can toggle/remove tools.

## Config keys

```yaml
mcp:
  tools_dir: "./tools"          # where packages install & load from
  lock_file: tools.lock.json    # install provenance (repo, pinned commit)
  hot_reload: true
dashboard:
  state_file: tool_state.json   # persisted disabled set
```

All anchor next to the active `config.yaml` (→ `~/.lesysbot/…` when installed),
so `lesysbot tools …` and the bot always resolve the same locations.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Not found: owner/repo@ref` | Check the spec; private repo → set `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |
| `tools dir already has X` | Folder not installed by LeSysBot — `--force` to overwrite. |
| Installed but not in `/help` | Restart the bot if `hot_reload` is off; check `~/.lesysbot/logs/lesysbot.log` for import errors. |
| Tool needs a pip package | Re-run with `--install-deps` or run the printed `pip install -r` line. |
| Tool shows "⚠ unavailable here" | Platform/binary gating — it's registered but this machine can't run it (wrong OS or a `requires` binary missing from PATH). |
