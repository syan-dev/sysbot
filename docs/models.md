# Choosing & Managing a Local Model

LeSysBot relies on **tool calling** (function calling) — the model must support it.
Every model recommended here does. This page helps you pick a model that fits
your hardware, manage it with Ollama, and point LeSysBot at it.

Using OpenAI or another remote backend instead? Skip this page — see
[Configuration §3](configuration.md#3-llm-backends).

## 1. Quick pick by GPU VRAM

VRAM numbers are approximate at Q4_K_M quantization; add ~1–2 GB overhead for
KV cache and OS.

| GPU VRAM | Recommended model | Pull command |
|---|---|---|
| 4 GB | Qwen3.5 4B | `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b` |
| 8 GB | Qwen3.5 9B ⭐ | `ollama pull qwen3.5` |
| 12 GB | Gemma4 12B | `ollama pull gemma4:12b` |
| 16 GB | Qwen3 14B | `ollama pull qwen3:14b` |
| 24 GB | Qwen3.5 27B | `ollama pull qwen3.5:27b` |
| 48 GB+ | Llama 3.3 70B | `ollama pull llama3.3:70b` |

⭐ Best balance of quality and speed for most hardware.

**Alternatives worth knowing at each tier:**

| Tier | Model | VRAM | Why pick it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 GB | Llama 3.2 3B (`llama3.2`) | ~3.6 GB | Small, fast starting point (~2 GB download) |
| 8 GB | Gemma4 12B (`gemma4:12b`) | ~7.6 GB | Native function calling; multimodal |
| 12 GB | DeepSeek R1 14B (`deepseek-r1:14b`) | ~9.5 GB | Strong reasoning / chain-of-thought |
| 16 GB | Gemma4 e4b (`gemma4:e4b`) | ~9.6 GB | MoE — very fast for its quality |
| 24 GB | Qwen3 32B (`qwen3:32b`) | ~22 GB | Excellent instruction following |
| 48 GB+ | Qwen3.5 122B (`qwen3.5:122b`) | ~81 GB | Needs 2× 48 GB GPUs or large unified memory |

**Coding-heavy tools?** If your LeSysBot tools involve writing or reviewing code,
`qwen3-coder:30b` (~18 GB, MoE) is the strongest open coding model;
`deepseek-coder-v2` (~9 GB) is a good mid-size option.

**Apple Silicon** shares RAM and VRAM in one unified pool — use total RAM as
your budget with the tables above (16 GB RAM → the 8–12 GB tier). Pull the
`-mlx` tag variants for better performance: `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b-mlx`.

## 2. Tips

- **Tool calling quality**: Qwen3.5 and Gemma4 have the most reliable tool
  calling in 2026 — they rarely hallucinate function names or drop required
  parameters. If LeSysBot picks the wrong tool or none at all, try one of these
  before debugging anything else.
- **MoE models** (e.g. Qwen3-Coder 30B) load fewer active parameters per token —
  faster than their total size suggests.
- **Quantization**: Ollama picks a sensible quantization automatically. For
  explicit control, append `:q4_K_M` (smaller/faster) or `:q8_0` (higher
  quality, more VRAM).
- **Out of memory**: try the next smaller size or a MoE variant.
- **Large contexts**: Qwen3.5 models have a 256K context window — you can raise
  `agent.max_history` (default 50) safely on them.

## 3. Managing models with Ollama

The commands you'll actually need:

```bash
ollama list                 # what's downloaded
ollama pull qwen3.5         # download a model
ollama rm llama3.2          # delete one
ollama ps                   # what's loaded in GPU memory right now
ollama stop qwen3.5         # unload a model, free VRAM
ollama run qwen3.5          # chat REPL — quick test before wiring into LeSysBot
```

**Is the server running?**

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/
# → Ollama is running
```

If not, start it: the official Linux installer registers a systemd service
(`sudo systemctl start ollama`); on macOS/Windows launch the Ollama app; or run
`ollama serve` in a terminal. For server administration beyond this — bind
address, storage location, keep-alive tuning — see the
[official Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs).

## 4. Pointing LeSysBot at the model

After pulling a model, set it in `config.yaml` (`~/.lesysbot/config.yaml` for an
installed setup):

```yaml
llm:
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
  model: "qwen3.5"        # ← name from `ollama list`
  api_key: "ollama"
```

Or one-off on the command line:

```bash
lesysbot --provider cli --model qwen3.5
```

Every backend (Ollama, vLLM, LlamaCpp, OpenAI) uses the same three settings —
the full matrix is in [Configuration §3](configuration.md#3-llm-backends).
