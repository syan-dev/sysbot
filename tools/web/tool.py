"""Web tools — async HTTP fetch using httpx.

Pure-Python and cross-platform. `httpx` is a pip dependency rather than a system
executable, so it isn't expressed as `requires=` (those are PATH binaries);
instead the tool checks for it at call time and tells you how to install it.
See requirements.txt.
