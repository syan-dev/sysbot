"""Power tools — reboot, power off, or cancel a pending shutdown.

These are destructive, so every action sets ``confirm=`` and the agent must get
approval through the adapter before the command runs. Commands are chosen per
platform and may need elevated privileges — on Linux, ``shutdown`` schedules
through logind with the same polkit rules as ``systemctl poweroff``, so
desktops usually don't need sudo.

Reboot/power-off are **scheduled 1 minute out** rather than run immediately:
an instant poweroff kills this process before the reply can reach the user, so
a remote (Telegram/Slack) user never learns whether the command was accepted.
The delay guarantees the acknowledgment arrives and leaves a window for
``cancel_shutdown`` to abort.
